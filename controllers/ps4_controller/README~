First install:

	- sudo pip install ds4drv

Then connect your controller to the PC and run:

	- sudo ds4drv --hidraw
The command will print out the mounted address for the controller. In my case it was /dev/input/js6.

Install https://github.com/ros-drivers/joystick_drivers in your ROS environment and do the following after running the roscore:

	- rosparam set joy_node/dev "/dev/input/js6"
	- rosrun joy joy_node
