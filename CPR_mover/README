First connect the robot to the pc. clone the following repository in your ROS environment:
    https://github.com/CPR-Robots/cpr_mover
    https://github.com/CPR-Robots/cpr_rviz_plugin.git

You probably will need to install some packages like peak_driver. You download the driver from here:
    http://www.peak-system.com/PCAN-USB.199.0.html
    http://www.peak-system.com/fileadmin/media/linux/index.htm
    http://www.peak-system.com/fileadmin/media/linux/files/PCAN-Driver-Linux_UserMan_eng.pdf

you also need libpopt-dev.
hopefully after this your catkin will be compilable.

Then do first:
    roslaunch cpr_rviz_plugin cpr_mover4.launch

And then do:
    rosrun cpr_mover cpr_mover

Then go to the script folder and run control_cpr.py. (You have had a controller set up before doing so
and set the controller name in the config.ini)
