# ROS_Teleoperate
ros_teleoperate is a simple repository to control different arms using different controllers.
right now it supports the mico and jaco arm controlled with ps4_controller and psmove controller.
We also have the code to control the al5d arm I just need to integrate it with the new design.
Any contribution is very welcomed, together we can make the teleoperation a thing from the past.
I will complete this README as I progress.
